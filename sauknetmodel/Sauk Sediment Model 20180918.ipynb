    "This is a beta version of a computational network-based sediment model was developed in order to connect processes of sediment supply on hillslopes, routing in streams, and deposition in reservoirs. The sediment model is developed in a framework called Landlab and driven by a physically-based, distributed hydrology model called DHSVM. The coupled sediment-hydrology model is designed to integrate relevant temporal and spatial scales of hillslope geomorphology, hydroclimatology and river network processes along with answering questions that are relevant to engineering application. The coupled model framework is designed to be applicable in other global watersheds, and could be useful for predicting sediment budgets particularly in the face of environmental and land use/land cover changes. \n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Sediment discharge, its frequency and magnitude, and the size distribution of sediment load vary in space and time in a river. Sediment input into channels can be dominated by a single source such as a stratovolcano (e.g., Glacier Peak), or can be from distributed sources on hillslopes and zero-order basins, as well as from the banks of the channel itself through bank erosion.  Sediment is either transported within the flow as suspended load or transported along the riverbed as bedload. Suspended sediment includes sediments that are transported in suspension as a result of flow shear stress. It is composed of wash load (mostly clay and silt that is more or less continually in suspension) and suspension from bedload during higher flow; bed material in suspension includes coarse silt and sand that may move as bed load during lower flow. Bedload is generally assumed to represent 10% (or more generally in the 5% to 20% range) of the total sediment load. This percentage also depends on the location in the channel network and the type of watershed soil type. The suspended sediment load varies with discharge, often increasing nonlinearly as discharge rises because the greater turbulence associated with higher discharge allows a greater load of sediment to be held in suspension. \n",

    "Two related questions of interest for predicting erosion rates and sediment yields in the Puget Sound region are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1)\tDo rivers that drain stratovolcanos and retreating glaciers exhibit larger erosion rates, and how modern and long-term erosion rates compare? \n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tCan a single suspendend sediment transport relationship predict loads across Puget Sound basins?\n",
    "\n",
    "In stratovolcanoes in high Alpine areas like Glacier Peak, a large portion of the loose pyroclastic deposits (clastic rock formed by volcanic explosion or ejected from a volcanic vent) are eroded by glaciers. Currently there are over a dozen glaciers on the sides of this volcano. In the model developed in this Notebook, we highlight network sediment results from seven glaciers; five in the Headwater Suiattle River (HUC 171100060201) including Dusty, Chocolate, Cool, Suiattle, and Honeycomb Glaciers and two in the Miners Creek Suiattle River (HUC 171100060202) including Vista and Ermine Glaciers.
